Aim: Using Data from all available countries, form a relationship between Suicide Rate and socio-economic factors. 

Data range: ASEAN Countries only
- Some countries do not have consistent data across different sources 
- Lack crucial data in years 
- Found that there is no consistent relationship (plausible relationship with GDPPPP)
 
Results: 
- Significant clustering of Data due to countries
- Unable to find any significant relationships
- Low R-squared value 
- Low *s 

Personality Test Scraping:
- Using Big Five Personality Model 
- Source website: Truity 
- loops through the site and automated the quiz, seeing how each question affects the final personality test results
- aims to compare these test results with user determined levels of suicidality (using machine learning)

Variables: 
GDPPPP - Gross Domestic Product (purchasing power parity) 
GDP - Gross Domestic Product 
IR - Inflation Rate 
UR - Unemployment Rate 
IPR - Internet Penetration Rate 
LR - Literacy Rate 
AP - Air Pollution Rate
